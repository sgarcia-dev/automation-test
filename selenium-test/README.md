#Selenium Test

Tests done using [Selenium Webdriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/javascript/node/selenium-webdriver). Tests are located in `test/**/*.js`. Tests are in [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

### How to run

* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm test`

###Â Notes/ToDo

* I was not able to figure out how to download and load chrome and firefox drivers dynamically (in hopes of eliminating `chromedriver` and `geckodriver` dependency)
